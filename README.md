To-Do List – Simple Task Management

1. What's the problem?
Staying organized and productive requires an easy way to track tasks, but many apps are overly complex or lack basic functionality like marking tasks as completed.

2. How am I going to solve it?
Develop a minimalist to-do list application that:
• Allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
• Stores task data locally to ensure persistent functionality without requiring external databases.
• Provides a clean and intuitive interface that focuses on simplicity and usability.

4. Any issues I came up with?
• Data Persistence: Ensuring that locally-stored data remains accessible across sessions without external database support.
• UI Simplicity: Balancing functionality with a minimalistic design to avoid over-complicating the user experience.

5. What is the final solution?
The To-Do List app is a lightweight, responsive task management tool that enables users to stay organized. Key features include:
• Local storage to save tasks persistently across sessions.
• CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
• A simple, intuitive UI built with React, ensuring a seamless user experience.
